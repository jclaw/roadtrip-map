Had a passionate debate about the color. (It was definitely yellow -SM).</p><p>Heart coffee shop in downtown portland. Weird drinks. Aidan got Conor a job at the church. Jackson forgot his pillow and returned to the house to retrieve a pillow which turned out not to be his. Various people in Portland compliment Conor\u2019s hat (thanks to Steven\u2019s suggestion that Portland is the perfect place to wear such a hat if you want compliments). \u00a0Then bookstore, wherein we get: <i>A</i> <i>Certain</i> <i>Lukas</i> by Julio Cortazar, <i>Secret Agent </i>by Joseph Conrad, and maybe some Neruda.</p><p></p><p>Garlic wheat thins.</p><p></p><p>Podcasts, then Elk. Followed by protecting the elk, and explaining to another passerby that there were elk crossing the road, who replied \u201cyeah they\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p></p><p>Ferry to victoria. Going through immigration. Jackson\u2019s alibi was really confusing. We were very worried about having our fruits and vegetables confiscated. \u00a0Worked on bios for church on the ferry. Hostel, the \u201cocean island inn,\u201d weird free drinks in hostel, working on first draft of \u201ccorner of my mind\u201d in hostel, then drinks with bandcamp. Keisha didn\u2019t realize that Conor was the guy she talked to about applying for a job. Walked around victoria at night.</p><p></p><p><i>Drank a strong drink in the morning. Tonic water, house honey and an espresso shot. It was pretty bad but made me feel crazy.</i></p><p></p><p>Got a lot done and then went to eat some tortas. The place was hip. Tried Jackson\u2019s good but grainy horchata.</p><p></p><p>Then on the road. Saw many elk in the swamp. Conor was among the first to spot the elk, and had to prove to himself and the group that they were not a mirage. We doubled back and got out of the car to see them and they were gone-most at least. We figured they were crossing the road so we walked back in the other direction. Tried to flag down traffic as they crossed. One van didn\u2019t want to slow down and just missed elk. Conor got video. The van was right next to us later in the ferry. Lots of cars close together in the car ferry. Friendly white bald guy at customs. Got to hostel. Woman working plays Celtic fiddle. Hostel fed us lentils and vodka ice tea drink. Lentils good, vodka bad. Worked on song and played it with Conor. Then out for drinks with Jackson\u2019s band camp friends. Vancouver seems cool. Hip like Montreal. Lots of homeless people. Pretty and clean. Feels bumpin\u2019 for a Wednesday. The water is nice. It\u2019s chilly and makes me nostalgic for fall. -AS</p>",

Saw a lot of homeless people and needle deposits on the streets. Brunch with bandcamp people. Ferry ride. US customs folks are worse than Canadian customs folks, not shockingly. Worried about money. Car to Seattle- \u201cCelegy\u201d in honor of celery. Then tonight in Rubin\u2019s house. The bathroom has door on skateboard wheels. You have to lean over to pee to avoid bumping head on ceiling. Guitar in bathroom, for enjoyment and privacy. We went to Mexican place. I got a cod burrito. Thought about Carmen San Diego a lot today. Talked about enemies at dinner. Peed on the side of the road and picked a blackberry to eat. Others were skeptical. \u00a0</p><p></p><p>Conflict between past aidan and present aidan about dates. Past aidan tasked conor with preventing present aidan from eating dates. \u00a0Aidan ended up eating the dates anyway, even though we tried to hide them.</p><p></p><p>Funny gossipy-high school situation in which maura was texting conor about kat, kat and maura were also texting a group text with jackson and conor, kat was texting conor, kat was texting jackson, and conor was telling rest of car about it. This during theo katzman album. Aidan and Steven felt excluded. Considered quitting the band and forming a touring blues duo.</p><p></p><p>Cherry Pie! \u00a0</p><p>Conor slept with jackson, who stole the blankets.</p><p></p><p>Sign \u201cAnaconda Opportunity\u201d in two separate places.</p><p>Another sign:</p><p>\u201cTwo mile road</p><p>One mile\u201d</p><p></p><p>\u201cI thrive in limbo.\u201d -AS</p>",

Conor got a free coffee.</p><p>Morning in Seattle, long driving day, hurt my back sleeping on small couch. Lots of talk about acres in the car. Lots of talk about state mottos in the AIR BnB. \u00a0</p><p></p><p>Postcard to Maura. Jackson drew his part while driving. (Video in folder)</p><p></p><p>Alicia very very happy to see everyone again (and to have transformed magically from a strawman!) Made sandwiches at starbucks.</p><p></p><p>Propositional logic of the seating arrangement:</p><p>If Jackson is driving, it is the morning, because Jackson always begins the day\u2019s drive. Also, if Jackson is driving, he is multitasking because he excels at ordinary tasks while driving. If Conor is driving, Jackson is in the passenger seat because he will be uncomfortable in the back seat, due to his size. If Jackson is in the back seat, he is grumpy. If Conor is driving, Aidan or Steven might also be uncomfortable because invariably one of them will want to stop to pee, and Conor will not want to stop. If Conor is driving and Jackson is in the passenger seat, Jackson takes up a secretarial office for Conor and works on both his and Conor\u2019s laptops simultaneously. If Conor is driving and Jackson is in the backseat, Steven is in the front seat and we are listening to guitar players. If Aidan is driving, Steven or Jackson are in the passenger seat. If Aidan is driving, Conor is not sleeping. If Aidan is driving and Steven is in the passenger seat, we are listening to Tim O\u2019Brien, Della Mae, or John Coltrane. If Alicia is driving, we are in the middle of the country. If Steven is driving, it is night time. If Jackson is driving and we stop at a gas station, Jackson fills up the tank. If anybody else is driving and we stop at a gas station, Jackson fills up the tank. If we stop at a gas station, Steven purchases potato chips.</p><p></p><p>At this point everyone has acquired a role in the car:</p><p>-Aidan refills water bottles and chews a lot of gum.</p><p>-Steven notices when we are out of gas.</p><p>-Jackson\u2019s really good at unpacking and repacking the trunk. \u00a0</p><p>-Conor\u2019s really good at making the sleeping bags fit in the overhead bin.</p><p>-Alicia and Aidan make great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.</p><p></p><p>\u201cHammer in the road\u201d</p><p></p><p>Hazy skies in Idaho in Montana. Listening to Gregory Alan Isakov at night and singing along.</p><p></p><p>\u201cSpokane like a true Montaner\u201d</p><p></p><p>Rest stop exercises:</p><p>Aerobics with aidan</p><p>stretching/stepping/stairs with steven</p><p>Cardio with conor</p><p>Jumping jacks with jackson</p><p>Abs with alicia</p><p></p><p>Guy in the gas station who said he couldn\u2019t pee on the side of the road because since he had a dog with him, it would be considered a felony. Then said, \u201cjust kidding, the police are great.\u201d Then left without washing his hands. Said, \u201cI only wash hands when I pee on them.\u201d We were confused. We all ran around the car a few times for exercise. </p><p></p><p>Conor drove for 530 miles. Set top speed record at 117mph. This during business meeting (photo in folder, Maura being skyped in).</p><p></p><p>Stopped for pizza for dinner. People were very friendly. Ms. America worked at this restaurant? (ASZ thinks it was Ms. Montana). There were twigs on the walls. Everyone had to pick their favorite extravagant decoration in the restaurant. </p><p></p><p>Story in the car about Jackson being in love with toast. The last line: \u201cWhy does love always disappear?\u201d Lots of unconventional relationships between inanimate objects in story. \u00a0Steven said lots of funny things. Everyone adopting Aidanisms.</p><p></p><p>Conor slept with Steven, who did not steal the blankets.</p>",

Probably the most beautiful place of my life. Swam in the hot springs. They were disorienting. Four temperatures at once, all extremes: the chilly river, the hot spring water, hot sun and cold breeze. Changed outside behind a tree. Saw a bison. It was big and noisy. Caught sunset at the Grand Tetons. Played duets with Steven as we watched. Came back to Driggs. Pitch black roads. Cooked a quick chili. Then sat around the bonfire drinking beer and roasting stale marshmallows. After played some music. Sang a song about the Grand Tetons from a poem in a history book. Then started just singing the history book. <i>Thought it sounded really bad.-AS (It sounded really good -S). (It was really creative and ASZ was impressed and even sang a verse. -ASZ).</i></p><p></p><p>Cooked midnight chili and drank beer and stayed up until 4 in the morning. Jackson debuts on the mandolin.

Not stressed because not conducting business meeting. Drove into town with Jackson and Conor and Steven. Really loved the huckleberry oreo milkshake.

And ate waffles for breakfast in the motel.</p><p></p><p>Saw Mount Rushmore briefly. Drove through really pretty hills and forests with sun shining down. \u00a0We drove through the first time and weren\u2019t going to park so we wouldn\u2019t have to pay, but it turns out you can\u2019t actually see anything without paying, so we went through again and paid our four dollars and then we saw it. <i>We didn\u2019t fit in.</i></p><p></p><p>Drove through Deadwood and aidan got Guthrie a present.</p><p></p><p>Everybody is sick of Conor\u2019s habit of drawing comparisons between the surrounding landscape and sci-fi stuff.</p><p></p><p>Drove into Badlands at dusk. At this point, we\u2019ve been listening to Prince for 3 hours. We decide prince is no longer the right vibe for the scenery and turn him off. Set up camp. Ate dinner (Beer and veggie burgers) by the glow of phonelight. Eyes adjust to the light.</p><p>There were a lot of really big spiders that kept scurrying out of their equally large holes. \u00a0There were even bigger holes that looked really scary and like they could potentially house giant spiders. \u00a0They turned out to only contain hundreds of really cute prairie dogs.</p><p>Walked in circles around the campground looking at stars. So many stars. \u00a0Giant orange moon!</p><p>Obligatory conversation about college in retrospect and what we want to do with our lives. Go to bed with necks sore from marveling at the wide expanse of the multiverse. Fell asleep to coyotes (voice memo in day 8 folder)</p>",

Aidan brought everyone to 38th and Garfield, the spot where his family recovered all of their stuff from the side of the road after it was stolen. </p><p></p><p>We had a great singing rehearsal in the car. \u00a0Most of us tend to be a little flat, except for Jackson who tends to be a little sharp. <i>I felt stressed because I don\u2019t like singing. -SM</i></p><p></p><p>A really big pigeon bounced off our windshield for no reason and we felt bad :( </p><p></p><p>Arrived in Madison. We were confused by college students. Felt superior and strange. Saw the house Aidan lived in for the first months of his life.<i> </i>While waiting for Adam to show up, Aidan played tenor banjo on his front lawn. Had a conversation with a guy there about banjo. Adam showed up and we ate pizza. Then, went to radio show. After went out to a bar. Tried local beer. Aidan played Dylan songs with random people outside.</p><p></p><p>Conor slept with Adam, who woke him up in the middle of the night with weird barking sounds. Conor has a hard time going back to sleep after this.</p>",

Finally got rid of all the shit in our cooler. \u00a0Conor played some really great electric guitar solos. <i>Guthrie had mentioned he wanted to play the Spin Doctors, which excited me</i>.</p>",
