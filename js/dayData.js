Also, if Jackson is driving, he is multitasking because he excels at ordinary tasks while driving. If Conor is driving, Jackson is in the passenger seat because he will be uncomfortable in the back seat, due to his size. If Jackson is in the back seat, he is grumpy. If Conor is driving, Aidan or Steven might also be uncomfortable because invariably one of them will want to stop to pee, and Conor will not want to stop. If Conor is driving and Jackson is in the passenger seat, Jackson takes up a secretarial office for Conor and works on both his and Conor\u2019s laptops simultaneously. If Conor is driving and Jackson is in the backseat, Steven is in the front seat and we are listening to guitar players. If Aidan is driving, Steven or Jackson are in the passenger seat. If Aidan is driving, Conor is not sleeping. If Aidan is driving and Steven is in the passenger seat, we are listening to Tim O\u2019Brien, Della Mae, or John Coltrane. If Alicia is driving, we are in the middle of the country. If Steven is driving, it is night time. If Jackson is driving and we stop at a gas station, Jackson fills up the tank. If anybody else is driving and we stop at a gas station, Jackson fills up the tank. If we stop at a gas station, Steven purchases potato chips.</p><div class=\"paraspacer\"></div><p>At this point everyone has acquired a role in the car:</p><p class=\"indented\">-Aidan refills water bottles and chews a lot of gum.</p><p class=\"indented\">-Steven notices when we are out of gas.</p><p class=\"indented\">-Jackson\u2019s really good at unpacking and repacking the trunk. \u00a0</p><p class=\"indented\">-Conor\u2019s really good at making the sleeping bags fit in the overhead bin.</p><p class=\"indented\">-Alicia and Aidan make great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.</p><div class=\"paraspacer\"></div><p>It was a long day.</p><div class=\"paraspacer\"></div><p>\u201cHammer in the road\u201d</p><div class=\"paraspacer\"></div><p>Hazy skies in Idaho in Montana. </p><div class=\"paraspacer\"></div><p>\u201cSpokane like a true Montaner\u201d</p><div class=\"paraspacer\"></div><p>Guy in the gas station who said he couldn\u2019t pee on the side of the road because since he had a dog with him, it would be considered a felony.
