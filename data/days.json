They both had to face a long distance relationship when Josh enrolls to University of Ithaca and Tiffany enrolls to the University of Austin. They made a promise to be true to each other and call each other every day.\n\nBut when Tiffany doesn't call Josh or answer any of his calls, Josh begins worrying that Tiffany is seeing another man (actually, her maternal grandfather died). To show that he is still in love with her, he makes a daily recorded video log to her.\n\nAfter a one-night stand with his friend Beth, Josh discovers that his sex with Beth has been taped, and, through a series of misunderstandings, the tape was sent to Tiffany instead of his latest blog entry."
